I designed a 3D map showing Nepal and the mountain ranges of the Himalayas. The goal of this exercise is to provide a visual perspective of the mountain ranges through three dimensional presentation. Coming into the exercise, I wanted to visualize something that would be best conveyed through 3D representation. I came upon the idea that I have always known about the Himalayas being the tallest mountain ranges in the world, and I was curious to see just how tall it is relative to the flat plains. Therefore, the objective of my map is provide a visual aid  for people to see how tall the mountain ranges are.

I believe that I was successful in creating the 3D portrayal of the mountain ranges and that it is visually engaging and that map users are able to pan and zoom around the map and have a closer look at the different ranges. One thing I was unsuccessful in providing a legend showing the different elevation according to different shades. In order to create my map, I utilized QGIS 3.6 and its Qgis2threejs plugin, I was also able to access the Nepal DEM from tile grabber which offered 30m resolution as well as other information such as city, population, and water bodies from other web sources.

I believe this map showcased the strength of 3D visualization, the reason is because the QGIS plugin allows map users to visualize information 3 dimensionally. Contrasting with 2D maps, map users lack the visuals to compare certain topography in the study area. Thus, they may be like me where I have always known the Himalayas being the tallest mountain ranges and that I have seen where it is on Google Map, but having this 3D representation greatly enforce my learning about its topography.
